3. Doctrinal Clarity: The Doctrinal Statement section of the website offers a comprehensive overview of the church's beliefs and theological positions. This serves as a reference point for both existing members and those interested in learning more about the church's core doctrines.

4. Church Timings: In an effort to inform the users about the timings and other programs conducted by the church, the website includes Join us section on the homepage. This section showcases church timings, weekly programs and a link to youtube channel where users can watch the live stream of the church.

5. Contact and Communication: The Contact section allows users to connect with the church directly. Whether someone has questions, wants to attend an event, or seeks guidance, this section facilitates communication between the church and its members and visitors.

The Berachah Good News Baptist Church Website project recognizes the evolving nature of community engagement and aims to cater to the digital needs of its congregation and the broader online community interested in the church's mission and teachings.
