### Accessibility
[Wave Accessibility](https://wave.webaim.org/) tool was eery helpful during the developemnt of the website. I was able check for any aid accessibility testing and fix the issues it showed.

Initially #BF8F02 color code was used for headings however when auditing site with wave, the color contrast failed and then the color code swapped with #926e02. Likewise the wave accesibility test helped to maintain the contrast ratio through the site.

- **0 errors in wave test:**

Optimized the site to achieve a score of 100 for accessibility, best practices and SEO for all of the pages. However the performance metric is lower than the other metrics due to issues like Serve static assets with an efficient cache policy . For the further projects will aim to optimize the performacce metric as well. However the current score is still good for all pages for performance metric.
