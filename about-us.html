                <h3>Our Founders</h3>
            <h3>
                <i>Late REV.M.MARK:</i>
            </h3>
                <p>
                    <p>
                        At a young age, Reverend M. Mark embraced the Lord Jesus Christ as his personal Savior and dedicated his life to ministry. He received his missionary training at Cherial Bible School in the Warangal District of Telangana. After completing his biblical education, he entered into matrimony with Mrs. Susheela. Both Reverend M. Mark and Susheela devoted themselves to serving the Lord in Andugulapally, near Peddapally, in the Karimnagar district.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                        In the year 1956, responding to the divine call, Reverend M. Mark, along with his family, made the significant decision to relocate to the Kataram area of the Karimnagar District. Upon arrival, they encountered a challenging environment characterized by dense forests and sparse habitation. The local populace struggled with illiteracy, lack of education, and societal discrimination, particularly against those from lower castes.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                        Kataram, situated at the border of three states—Telangana, Maharashtra, and Chhattisgarh—lacked basic amenities such as electricity and transportation infrastructure. However, fueled by an unwavering passion and a burden for souls, Reverend Mark embarked on a tireless mission to serve the Lord. He extended his ministry to various regions, including Mahadevpur, Mahamutharam, Singampally, Malhar Rao, and the Kataram mandals.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                        Undaunted by the challenges, Reverend Mark traversed on foot, visiting every village, and proclaiming the Good News of Lord Jesus Christ. His commitment to his calling was evident in his resilience, even in the face of perilous encounters with fierce wild animals, such as tigers. Through his dedicated efforts, he led hundreds of souls to Christ and established numerous churches across the villages.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                        In the year 2001, Reverend M. Mark faced a grave trial when he was struck by paralysis, rendering him bedridden until 2012. Despite his physical affliction, his faith remained steadfast. On June 3, 2012, he peacefully departed from this world to be with the Lord.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                        Reverend M. Mark's life was a testament to his unwavering commitment to his faith and his unrelenting efforts to spread the message of Christ in the most challenging of circumstances.
                        </p>

                <h3>
                    <i>REV.M.TIMOTHY:</i>
                </h3>
                    <p>
                        <p>
                            Rev. M. Timothy is the younger son of Rev. M. Mark, born on May 14, 1969. During his teenage years, Pastor Timothy accepted Jesus Christ as his Personal Savior and dedicated himself to the service of the Lord. After completing his secular studies, he underwent a three-year theological training program at the New Life Bible College in Hyderabad, earning his Bachelor's in Theology.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                            Following his theological education, he worked with the Every Home Crusade of Asia for several years. Subsequently, he entered the sacred bond of marriage with Hemalatha, and they were blessed with two sons. After their marriage, Rev. Timothy served the Lord in Regonda of Warangal District, where he established a church.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                            Responding to God's call, he decided to serve the Lord in Kataram and assist his father in ministry. Rev. Timothy was a steadfast Baptist with a strong commitment to doctrinal teachings. He served as a pastor in the churches established by his father and also played a pivotal role in founding Berachah Goodnews Ministries.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                            Rev. Timothy's passion for ministry led him to lead numerous individuals to Christ and establish new churches, all for the glory of God. He conducted open-air public meetings, pastors' seminars, summer Bible schools, and provided training for many young people who have gone on to serve as pastors in various districts of Telangana State.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                            Despite his relatively young age, at 45, Rev. M. Timothy entered into the Lord's Glory on April 8, 2013, in a tragic road accident while returning home after solemnizing a marriage.

            <h3>
                Doctrinal Statement of Berachah Goodnews Baptist Church
            </h3>
            <p> 
                <p>
                    <strong>We believe</strong> that the Bible is the divinely Inspired Word of God. And King James "Authorized Version" Bible to be the perfect and infallible word of God for English Speaking people. We believe the Bible was inspired in its origination and is throughout its various generations and languages until it reached us in its final form. By this we mean that the Authorized Version preserves the very words of God in the form in which He wished them to be represented in the universal language of these last days. (2 Timothy 3:16, John 20:31, 2 Peter 1:20,21)
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    <strong>We believe</strong> that salvation is by grace through faith in the blood of Lord Jesus Christ and is not of works but the finished atonement of Jesus Christ at Calvary. And no good work of man is enough to please God. Salvation includes regeneration, justification, sanctification, and glorification. (Ephesians 1:7; 2:8-22, Philippians 2:12-13, Revelation 21:17)
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    <strong>We believe</strong> in Baptism that is in the name of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. And believers should be immersed in water after being saved. Such believers' baptism is an ordinance but is not a means of grace. We reject infant baptism and any form of sprinkling for infants or adults. Baptism is an outward expression of our faith in Jesus Christ and simply a public testimony of what God has done by His grace. Also, we believe the other ordinance to be the Lord's Supper or Communion. We believe in open communion, you do NOT have to be a church member to participate. This is a memorial and again, not a means of grace. (Romans 6:1-5; Acts 8:36-38, Matthew 28:19-20,24)
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    <strong>We believe</strong> in a premillennial, pretribulational translation or rapture of the Church. And Jesus Christ will return with His Church After Great Tribulation. We believe that unbelievers will face God and be judged at the Great White Throne Judgment according to their works, not for salvation, but for their proper and rightful places in the lake of fire. (1 Thessalonians 4:13-18, Revelation 4:1, Matthew 16:27; Mark 14:62; John 14:3; Acts 1:11; Phil. 3:20; 1 Thessalonians 4:15; II Timothy 4:1; Titus 2:13; 1 Corinthians 4:5; 1 Corinthians 15; 2 Thessalonians 1:7-10; Revelation 20:4-6,11-15)
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    <strong>We believe</strong> the miracle signs and gifts belong primarily to Israel, dispensationally speaking, and that these signs as practiced by the Charismatics and Apostolics are exercised mainly in the flesh, are most often fraudulent, and sometimes demonic and devilish in nature. The Holy Spirit is given to each believer upon acceptance of Christ. Speaking in tongues was the least important of these gifts and was given as a sign for unbelieving Jews. (John 7:37-39; 14:17; Acts 2:38; 1 Corinthians 1:22; 3:16-17; 6:19-20; 12-14)
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    <strong>We believe</strong> that a depraved and sinful nature and a naturally dead spirit do not hinder a man from being a free moral agent who is capable and expected by God to will and believe and respond to the admonitions of the Gospel. Men are free to reject God's graciousness in providing a free salvation. Further, Jesus Christ died for "all" without exception. (John 3:14,16; 5:24; John 5:30; 7:13; 8:12; 10:26; Romans 9:22; II Thessalonians 1:9; Revelation 19:3,20; 20:10;14,15; 21:18)
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    <strong>We believe</strong> there is eternal security for the believer; a man is secured in his salvation eternally and unconditionally at the moment he believes, and each believer is kept by the power of God, and nothing can separate us from Him, ourselves included. This condition is secured by the numerous irreversible works of God and the Holy Spirit. If any man commits sin after believing in Jesus, he loses the joy of fellowship and grieves the Holy Spirit, but he will not lose his salvation. (John 3:16; 5:24; 6:37-39; 10:27-30; Romans 8:35-39; Philippians 1:6; Titus 1:2; 1 Peter 1:5; 1 John 5:11-13; Jude 24)
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    <strong>We believe</strong> that the saints should be separate from the world as pilgrims and sojourners, that the world is evil in its nature and that Satan is its primary god and governor. (2 Timothy 3:1-5; Romans 12:1-2,14:13; 1 John 2:15-17; 2 John 9-11; 2 Corinthians 6:14-7:1)
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    <strong>We believe</strong> in evangelism and it is the Greatest Command of the Lord, the active and vigorous pursuit of lost sinners by street preaching, tract distribution, and any other reasonable and appropriate methods of sowing the seed of the word of God. We believe that it is the duty of every believer to make disciples. (Matthew 16:18; 28:18-20; Mark 16:15; John 20:21; Acts 1:8; 2 Corinthians 5:18-21; 1 Peter 2:9; Revelation 1:6; 5:10)
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    <strong>We believe</strong> the trinitarian doctrine of the Godhead and therefore believe Jesus Christ not only to be the Son of God but also God Himself, the image of God, God manifest in the flesh. We also find abundant evidence that the Holy Spirit as both God's and Christ's Spirit is Himself God, as well. (Genesis 1:1,26; John 1:1,3; Matthew 28:19; John 4:24; Romans 1:19,20; Ephesians 4:5,6)
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    <strong>We believe</strong> in heaven and it is that inheritance is incorruptible and undefiled. We believe in a literal, hot and burning Hell and future Lake of Fire. (Matthew 13:41-43; Mark 9:43-48; Luke 16:19-24; John 14:2; 2 Corinthians 5:8; Revelation 21-22)
                    </p>
